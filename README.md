About Me

I am a student in the Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics program, where I focus on understanding how machine learning models interpret complex patterns, especially in visual and cognitive domains. My academic background in psychology and my interest in neuroscience guide my approach to AI, connecting human cognition with computational models.

AI Focus

My work explores image classification, neural networks, and explainable AI. I am particularly interested in how artificial intelligence can support cognitive assessment, mental health tools, and early detection models.
